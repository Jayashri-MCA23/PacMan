# Pacman

**Description:**

     This HTML page creates a simple animation of a Pac-Man character moving horizontally within a container. The Pac-Man initially faces right and moves back and forth. Key components include the container, Pac-Man image, and JavaScript for animation control.The JavaScript code manipulates Pac-Man's position and direction, updating his image to simulate the open-close mouth animation effect. When Pac-Man reaches the container's boundaries,  reverses direction. The setInterval function ensures that the move function is repeatedly called every 100 milliseconds, creating a continuous Pac-Man animation.
**How to run code:**

     step1:-Save the HTML file with .html extension.
     step2:-"Go Live" button at the bottom right corner of the VSCode window.
     Click the "Go Live" button.
     step4:-A new browser window will open, displaying  Pacman animation.
**Future Improvemennt:**

     For future improvement, consider adding obstacles or interactive elements within the container for Pac-Man to interact with, adding sound effects, or incorporating user controls for changing Pac-Man's direction and speed, enhancing the overall user experience.
