# Pacman
Description:
     This HTML page creates a simple animation of a Pac-Man character moving horizontally within a container. The Pac-Man initially faces right and moves back and forth. Key components include the container, Pac-Man image, and JavaScript for animation control.
The JavaScript code manipulates Pac-Man's position and direction, updating his image to simulate the open-close mouth animation effect. When Pac-Man reaches the container's boundaries,  reverses direction. The setInterval function ensures that the move function is repeatedly called every 100 milliseconds, creating a continuous Pac-Man animation.
How to run code:
     step1:-Save the HTML file with .html extension.
     step2:-"Go Live" button at the bottom right corner of the VSCode window.
Click the "Go Live" button.
     step4:-A new browser window will open, displaying  Pacman animation.
